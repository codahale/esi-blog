An experiment in leveraging Edge-Side Includes to build an application with the
following properties:

  1. Doesn't suck to develop.
  2. Uses as much HTTP-level caching as possible.
  3. Leverages HTTP invalidation side-effects (e.g., POST clears cache) to make
     cache invalidation not suck so much.

= Getting Squid3 To Work =

Ho man. This is complicated.

1. Install an ESI-enabled version of Squid3:

  sudo apt-get build-deps squid3
  apt-get source squid3
  cd squid3*
  nano debian/rules
  <add --enable-esi to the list of config flags>
  debuild -us -uc
  cd ..
  sudo dpkg -i *.deb

2. Configure it:

  sudo ln -s THIS_APP/config/squid3-development.conf /etc/squid3/squid.conf

3. (Re)Start it:

  sudo /etc/init.d/squid3 restart

An experiment in leveraging Edge-Side Includes to build an application with the
following properties:

  1. Doesn't suck to develop.
  2. Uses as much HTTP-level caching as possible.
  3. Leverages HTTP invalidation side-effects (e.g., POST clears cache) to make
     cache invalidation not suck so much.
